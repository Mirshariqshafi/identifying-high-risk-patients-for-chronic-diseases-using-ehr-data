This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the risk of chronic diseases using a machine learning model trained on electronic health records (EHR) data.

ðŸš€ Features
User-friendly Streamlit web interface

Predicts chronic disease risk based on user-inputted health data

Uses a pre-trained machine learning model and scaler

Built with reproducibility in mind

ðŸ“Š Input Features
The app collects the following health features:

Age

BMI

Blood Pressure

Glucose Level

Cholesterol Level

Smoking status

Physical activity level

(Modify based on what your app uses!)

ðŸ’» Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
bash
Copy
Edit

cd chronic-disease-risk-app
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
ðŸ§  Model Training (Optional)
If you want to retrain the model from scratch:

bash
